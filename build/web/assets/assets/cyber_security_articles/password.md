- **Do not use the "Remember Password"** feature in web browsers for any service.
- **Create strong passwords** by combining:
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters (e.g. `@#$%^&*()_+|~-=\`{}[]:";'<>/`)
- **Avoid weak passwords** such as:
  - Less than 10 characters
  - Words found in any language dictionary
  - Common usage words (e.g., names of family, pets, colleagues; movie or book titles)
  - Computer terms, company names, commands, or websites
  - Personal information (birthdays, addresses, phone numbers)
  - Number or word patterns (e.g., `qwerty`, `aaaaa`, `iocl123`, `iocl@june2019`)
- **Select different passwords** on expiry without repeating the last five passwords.
- **Never speak out or disclose your password** in front of others.
- **Do not reveal even the smallest hint** related to your password.
