## Safe Browsing Habits

- Never store your credentials (like passwords) in your browser, especially for banking or e-commerce sites.
- Avoid clicking on advertisements and commercials on social networking sites.
- Always check the URL for correct spelling and domain (e.g., `icicibank.com` vs. `iciciibank.com`).
- For financial transactions, **type the URL directly** into the address bar. Do not click on links from emails or ads, as these may be phishing attempts.
- Make a habit of clearing your browsing history and deleting cookies after each logout session.

2. At the top right, click **More**.
3. Click **More tools** > **Clear browsing data**.

## Device and Data Safety

- Never perform online financial transactions on public computers (e.g., in airports).
- Download software only from trusted sources such as official app stores or legitimate organizations (like your bank).
- Avoid using torrents. Torrents distribute data across many users, making files harder to trace and potentially riskier to download.
- Do not download copyrighted material (movies, music, etc.) unless it is from the official owner.

### How to Delete Temporary Files in Windows

1. Open the **Run** dialog box (`Win + R`).
2. Type `%temp%` and press **Enter**.
3. Select all files in the folder (`Ctrl + A`).
4. Press **Delete**.

## Smart Clicking and Downloading

- Be cautious about what you click or download. Pause and think before clicking links in emails, messages, or social media.
- As a rule, do not click on links from unknown senders or unexpected messages.
- If a link looks suspicious, hover over it to see the actual web address before clicking (usually shown at the bottom of the browser window).
- Always read the terms and conditions before clicking “I Agree” or “Accept” on any website or application.
- Be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. Leave websites that ask for your personal or banking details in return for money – these are scams.

## What is a Cookie?

> **A cookie** is a text file that a web browser stores on your device. Cookies help websites remember your preferences, login status, and other session information.  
> They are used for authentication, storing website information/preferences, and tracking browsing activity.  
> While cookies can improve your browsing experience, they can also be used to track your online behavior, so it's good practice to clear them regularly.

---

## What is a Pop-up Blocker?

> **Pop-ups** are windows that appear automatically while browsing, often used for advertisements or notifications.  
> A **pop-up blocker** is a browser feature that prevents these windows from appearing.  
> Most browsers have built-in pop-up blockers.  
> - For legitimate needs (like online banking), you may need to allow pop-ups temporarily.  
> - Be cautious, as many pop-ups are used for ads or scams.
