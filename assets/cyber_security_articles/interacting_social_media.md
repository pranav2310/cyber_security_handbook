# Interacting on Social Media: Safety Best Practices

Stay safe and protect your privacy while using social networking platforms by following these essential guidelines.

---

## 1. Account Registration & Information Sharing

- **Use a Dedicated Email:**  
  Do not use your official email address for registering on social networking sites. Create and use a personal email address strictly for this purpose.

- **Choose Secure Security Questions:**  
  When registering, select a security question that only you can answer.

- **Limit Personal Details:**  
  Never share sensitive personal details (like your mother’s maiden name or your native city) with unknown persons. These are often used to verify your identity.

## 2. Managing Connections

- **Verify Friend Requests:**  
  Do not accept friend requests from unknown individuals unless you can verify their identity.

- **Protect Official Information:**  
  Never share your official email ID or organizational information (like hierarchy or networks) on social networking sites.

## 3. Privacy & Posting

- **Be Careful What You Share:**  
  Refrain from sharing personal details or posting anything that could embarrass you or put you in an awkward situation in the future.

- **Limit Shared Information:**  
  Submit only the minimum necessary information about yourself. Regularly check what others are posting about you and be cautious when posting about others.

## 4. Beware of Social Engineering

- **Unexpected Contacts:**  
  Be wary of unexpected visits, phone calls, or emails from people seeking personal or organizational information. Verify their identity directly with the company they claim to represent.

- **Never Share Credentials:**  
  Legitimate service providers or administrators will never ask for your credentials for troubleshooting or assistance.

## 5. Safe Browsing & Access

- **Avoid Suspicious Links:**  
  Never click on URLs in emails claiming to be from social networking sites. These could lead to “cloned” (fake) websites designed to steal your information.  
  **Always log in directly** to the official website or app.

- **Avoid Public Devices & Networks:**  
  Do not access your social networking accounts from shared or public computers, or through public Wi-Fi hotspots.

## 6. Website Cloning & Phishing

### What is Website Cloning?

> Website cloning is the process of copying an existing website’s look and functionality. Attackers can use cloned sites for phishing attacks, tricking users into entering their credentials on a fake site.

### Countermeasures

- **Check the URL:**  
  Ensure the site is safe and secure. Look for a padlock symbol in the address bar and make sure the URL begins with `https://`.

- **Verify the Source:**  
  Always check the source of a message before clicking on links. If you are unsure about the sender, do not click any links in the message.

By following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft, phishing, and privacy breaches on social media.
