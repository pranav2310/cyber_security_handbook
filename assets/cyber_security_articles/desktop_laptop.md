## Software Management

## Anti-Virus Protection

- **Ensure AV is Always Running:** Look for the AV icon in the system tray (lower right corner near the date/time).
- **Keep AV Updated:** Regularly update your AV software for the latest protection.
- **Never Disable AV Components:** Even if it slows down your PC, AV protects your data from threats.

## Responsible Device Usage

- **Use Password-Protected Screen Savers:** Adds an extra layer of security.
- **Separate User Accounts:** If someone else needs to use your PC, have them use their own account.
- **Never Share Credentials:** Sharing your account details can lead to unauthorized access across multiple applications.
