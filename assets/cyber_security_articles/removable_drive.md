## Important Guidelines

- Media that has developed a fault or has been damaged should **not** be given to an external agency for remediation—it might contain personal or important information.
- **Avoid storing sensitive data** (bank account details, Aadhaar details, etc.) on removable media. If you must, take utmost care while handling such media.
- **Do not keep hidden files or folders** in the storage media.
- **Do not fall prey to ‘Baiting’:** Never use any electronic storage device from an unknown or untrusted source. Such devices may contain malware intended to hack systems.
- If auto-scan is not enabled, **always scan removable media for malicious content** before storing data on it.
- Over time, many removable media (especially pen-drives) accumulate. **Destroy older, rarely used drives** as they might contain useful information that could be misused if found by others.
- **Keep separate media for personal and official use**—use identifiers (e.g., colored tags) for easy distinction.

## What is USB 2.0 / USB 3.0?

**USB** is a standard that defines the maximum “signaling speeds” (data transfer rates) for communication across a USB port.
- **USB 2.0** offers a theoretical maximum signaling rate of **480 megabits per second**.
- **USB 3.0** defines a maximum rate of **5 gigabits per second**—over ten times faster than USB 2.0.

**Identification:**
- USB 3.0 ports are generally colored **blue** inside.
- USB 2.0 ports are typically **grey**.
- Many computers have both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports.
