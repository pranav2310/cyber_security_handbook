# Portable Smart Device Security

Smart devices—such as smartphones and tablets—offer powerful features like computing power, wireless networking, internet access, GPS, imaging, and more. These capabilities also make them vulnerable to security threats. Follow these best practices to keep your smart devices secure.

## 1. Manage Connectivity and Apps

- **Disable Unused Connections:**  
  Keep Bluetooth, NFC (Near Field Communication), mobile data, and Wi-Fi modules disabled when not in use.
- **Disable Rarely Used Apps:**  
  Turn off or disable apps you rarely use so they don’t run in the background.
- **Install Only Necessary Apps:**  
  Be cautious with free apps. Always check user reviews and only install applications you truly need.
- **Install Antivirus:**  
  Install a reputable antivirus app immediately on first use. Most leading antivirus companies provide mobile security suites with additional features.

## 2. Monitor Device Health

- **Watch for Unusual Activity:**  
  Fast battery drainage or unexplained heating may indicate malicious activity or ongoing data transfer. Investigate such issues promptly.
- **Monitor Data Usage:**  
  Keep an eye on mobile data usage and network activity for signs of compromise.

## 3. Device Lock and SIM Protection

- **Enable Auto-Lock:**  
  Set your device to lock automatically after a short period of inactivity.
- **Use Secure Screen Lock:**  
  Choose a strong method (biometrics, PIN, password, or pattern).  
  *(Settings > Security > Screen Lock)*
- **Set Up SIM PIN:**  
  This will prompt for a PIN whenever the device is started, restarted, or the SIM is inserted into another device.

## 4. Privacy and Safe Usage

- **Never Jailbreak Your Device:**  
  Jailbreaking removes built-in protections, allowing unsecure apps and increasing malware risk.
- **Block Camera When Needed:**  
  In sensitive locations, cover the camera with an opaque sticker to prevent unauthorized surveillance.
- **Review App Permissions:**  
  Only consent to apps that request necessary access. Uninstall apps that ask for excessive permissions.
- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Accounts:**  
  Don’t sign into financial or sensitive accounts over public Wi-Fi hotspots.
- **Never Share App Passwords:**  
  Even with family, as passwords are often stored on the device and could be compromised if the device is lost.

## 5. Data Management and Backup

- **Regularly Delete Downloads:**  
  Remove files and email attachments that are no longer needed.
- **Enable Data Backup:**  
  Use services like Google Backup (Settings > Personal > Backup & Reset) and keep a regular backup on your home PC.
- **Record Your IMEI:**  
  Keep your device’s IMEI number in a safe place. *(Dial \*#06# to get the IMEI.)*
- **Avoid Syncing Personal Data with Official Apps:**  
  For example, syncing contacts with official email can result in data loss if the account is deactivated.
- **Erase Data Before Disposal:**  
  Thoroughly erase phone memory before disposing of the device. Destroy old SIM or memory cards if not reused.

## 6. Technical Terms

### What is NFC / Bluetooth / Wi-Fi?

- **NFC (Near Field Communication):**  
  Enables short-range data transfer between supported devices. Requires one transmitting and one receiving device.
- **Bluetooth:**  
  Short-range wireless technology for transmitting data or voice between devices like phones, computers, and peripherals.
- **Wi-Fi:**  
  Allows devices to connect to the internet or each other wirelessly within a specific area, providing high-speed network connections.

### What is Jailbreak?

> **Jailbreaking** is the process of removing manufacturer or carrier restrictions from a device (like an iPhone or iPad) by exploiting vulnerabilities, often to install unauthorized software.  
> **Warning:** Jailbreaking increases the risk of malware, hacking, and remote access by intruders.
