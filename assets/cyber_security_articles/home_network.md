# Networking at Home

Default passwords should be changed before configuring the broadband router.

For Wi-Fi routers, the SSID (Service Set Identifier) name used should **not** give away information about the location or home address owner, for example, “Ashok-home” or “A102-Internet”.

The SSID name should be unique and memorable.

Ideally, the SSID broadcasting should be disabled so that no one is able to see the SSID (log into the home router, go to “wireless settings” and disable “SSID Broadcast”).

Regularly log into the router and check for the “Connected / Attached devices” (log into the router and under “Wireless Status”, check for “Connected / Attached Devices”). This information helps you know which devices are connected and using the internet service. If any suspicious device is found, remove it and change the password for connection.

Use WPA2 or higher in the wireless security settings. This can be enabled by logging into the router and going to Wireless Settings -> Security Settings -> change the setting to WPA2 or preferably WPA2-PSK. Enter your new password, and reboot the router.

If the router does not support WPA2 or WPA2-PSK, replace it at the earliest.

Do not select “Auto-Connect” or “Connect Automatically” option in your computers or mobiles while using a Wi-Fi network, especially for open Wi-Fi networks (such as those at airports, hotels, etc).

## What is SSID?

SSID is short for Service Set Identifier. In layman's terms, an SSID is the name for a Wi-Fi network.

People typically encounter an SSID when they use a mobile device to connect to a wireless network. For example, if you take your laptop to a coffee shop and attempt to connect to the local Wi-Fi, your screen will display a list of SSIDs — these are the names of all the networks within range of your device.

## What is WPA?

**WPA** stands for "Wi-Fi Protected Access." WPA is a security protocol designed to create secure wireless (Wi-Fi) networks. It is similar to the WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) protocol, but offers improvements in the way it handles security keys and user authorization.

For encrypted data transfer to work, both systems at the beginning and end of a transfer must use the same encryption/decryption key. While WEP provides each authorized system with the same key, WPA uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which dynamically changes the key that the systems use. This prevents intruders from creating their own encryption key to match the one used by the secure network.

WPA also implements the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for authorizing users. Instead of authorizing computers based solely on their MAC address, WPA can use several other methods to verify each computer's identity. This makes it more difficult for unauthorized systems to gain access to the wireless network.
