## 1. Before You Buy

- **Check Seller Legitimacy:**  
  Read user reviews for both the product and the seller. If possible, call or visit the actual store to confirm legitimacy.
- **Be Critical of Reviews:**  
  Use discretion with online reviews; some may be biased or manipulated by sellers or competitors.
- **Understand Terms:**  
  Familiarize yourself with the e-commerce portal’s terms, conditions, and transaction methods. Compare with other reputable sites to avoid oversharing personal information.

## 2. Avoiding Scams and Phishing

- **Ignore Unsolicited Offers:**  
  Do not entertain unsolicited emails from unknown websites, especially if they contain links or attachments.
- **Enable Phishing Filters:**  
  Always keep phishing filters enabled in your browser  
  - *IE:* Tools → Windows Defender SmartScreen Filter → Turn On  
  - *Chrome:* Settings → Privacy → Enable Phishing & Malware Protection

## 3. Secure Online Banking

- **Use Virtual Keyboards:**  
  If available, use a virtual keyboard for online banking logins to avoid keyloggers.
- **Register for Alerts:**  
  Sign up for email and SMS alerts to be notified immediately of any transaction or account changes.
- **Verify Messages:**  
  Cross-check messages from banks by calling their authorized contact numbers.
- **Update Contact Information:**  
  Keep your address updated for timely and accurate delivery of bank instruments and statements.
- **Review Statements Regularly:**  
  Check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions. If found, change your PIN/password and report immediately to your bank and cyber police.

## 4. Data Privacy and Card Security

- **Destroy Unused Cards:**  
  Physically cut unused credit/debit cards and call the bank to cancel them. Obtain confirmation of cancellation.
- **Do Not Share Data:**  
  Instruct your bank not to share your data for freebies like free credit cards.
- **Recognize Fraudulent Communications:**  
  Legitimate financial institutions never ask for personal/account information via SMS, email, or WhatsApp. Discard such communications.

## 5. Why Do Companies Use Only SSL for E-Commerce Websites?

- **Protects Customers' Login Information:**  
  SSL encrypts data, keeping login credentials safe from interception.
- **Prevents Session Hijacking:**  
  SSL ensures cookies and session data are not sent in plaintext, reducing the risk of hijacking.
- **Guards Against Fake Websites:**  
  SSL helps ensure customers are not redirected to fraudulent sites.

## 6. Understanding Security Tools

### What is CAPTCHA?

> **CAPTCHA** (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a challenge–response test used to determine whether the user is human, helping to prevent spam and automated attacks.  
> Usually, you must type letters or numbers from a distorted image. It takes the average person about 10 seconds to solve a typical CAPTCHA. [8][12]

---

### What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

> **2FA** is an extra layer of security requiring two forms of identification before accessing an account:
> - **Something you know:** Password, PIN, or answers to security questions.
> - **Something you have:** A credit card, smartphone, or hardware token.
> - **Something you are:** Biometrics like fingerprint, iris scan, or voice print.
>
> With 2FA, even if one factor is compromised, unauthorized access is still prevented.  
> Always enable 2FA wherever possible for your online accounts. [9][13]
