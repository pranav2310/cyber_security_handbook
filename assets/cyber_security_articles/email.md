# Communicating Over Email: Best Practices

Protect yourself and your organization by following these essential email security guidelines.

---

## Password and Session Security

- **Do not save email passwords** in web browsers or on mobile phones.
- **Change your email password** at least once every 30 days.
- **Always sign out** after finishing your email session to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access.

---

## Mailbox Hygiene

- **Keep your mailbox clean:**  
  Regularly delete unwanted messages and archive important ones.
- **Always keep a personal copy** of your mailbox (e.g., PST files for Microsoft Exchange).

---

## Attachment Safety

- **Do not open attachments** with extensions like:  
  `.VBS`, `.DLL`, `.EXE`, `.SHS`, `.PIF`, `.SCR`, `.U64`
- **Be wary of deceptive extensions:**  
  Hackers may use double extensions (e.g., `.txt.exe`, `.doc.exe`) to trick you.
- **Never open unexpected or unsolicited attachments.**  
  Immediately delete suspicious attachments.

## Understanding Email Threats

### What is Email Spam?

> **Email spam**, also known as junk email, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming).

### What is a Digital Signature?

> A **digital signature** is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document.  
> It is the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, offering much greater security.  
> Digital signatures provide evidence of origin, identity, and status of an electronic document, transaction, or message, and can acknowledge informed consent by the signer.

### What is Phishing?

> **Phishing** is the act of sending an email that falsely claims to be from a legitimate enterprise, attempting to scam the user into surrendering private information for identity theft.  
> Phishing emails typically direct users to a website where they are asked to update personal information (such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account details) that the legitimate organization already has.
